English Japanese Keyboard is an app written in Python to make it easier to type in Japanese without needing to change any language settings on the operating system.

To launch the app, run `EnglishJapaneseKeyboard.py`

`CustomButton.py` contains the `ChangingButton` class that extends `ttk.Button`, making it possible to switch between multiple button values.
